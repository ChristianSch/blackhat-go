We are hackers and coders - in that order.

This means that, as hackers, we put a premium on function over elegance as time is always scarce.

When you need to quickly create a solution to a problem, style concerns come secondary.

## Why use Go for Hacking?
Prior to Go, you could prioritize ease of use by using dynamically typed languages-such as Python, Ruby or PHP-at the expense of performance and safety.

Alternatively, you could choose a statically typed language, like C or C++, that offers high performance and safety but isn't very user-friendly.

Go is a stripped of much of the ugliness of C, its primary ancestor, making development more user-friendly.

At the same time it's statically typed producing syntax errors at compile time increasing assurance that your code will actually run safely.

Many of the language's features are particularly useful for hackers and adversaries:

1. Clean Package Management System
2. Cross Compilation
3. Rich Standard Library
4. Concurrency

### Downsides
1. Large Binary size
2. Very Verbose
